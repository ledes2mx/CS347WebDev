            This week, I decided to look a little more into jQuery. I know that there is probably another way to have tabs that bring up different things related to topics, but I
            find that sometimes, jQuery just has this stuff laying there, and it might be useful to use if you really want to use it. What I mean by tabs is literally having tabs
            with just words in there or probably something else in there, but having them appear when the tab is active. This actually isn't that difficult to do either, as it
            turns out. All you really need to do in you jQuery script is...
        </p>
        <pre>
            $(document).ready(function() {
                $("#tabs").tabs();
            });
        </pre>
        <p>
            In your body, you have to have a div with the id, in this case "tabs" is the id, and in an unordered list you have to have an anchor linking them to divs that have ids
            like in the example below.
        </p>
        <pre>
            &lt;div id="tabs"&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="#tab1"&gt; Tab 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="#tab2"&gt; Tab 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div id="tab1"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is the first tab!&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div id="tab2"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is the second tab!&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

        </pre>
        <p>
            As you can see below, you can clearly click on each tab to see what each of them has inside of them.
        </p>

        <div id="tabs">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#tab1">Tab 1</a></li>
                <li><a href="#tab2">Tab 2</a></li>
            </ul>

            <div id="tab1">
                <p>This is the first tab!</p>
            </div>

            <div id="tab2">
                <p>This is the second tab!</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            You also can't 
        </p>
