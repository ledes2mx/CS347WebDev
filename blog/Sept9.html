            This week, I learned relearned things about CSS stylings that I had
            recently forgotten about and more recently learned about box modeling.
            For instance, I learned about the alternation of boxes in a way that would
            make a chess or checker board pattern. At first, I thought that there was no 
            way to loop code in CSS, but I was gravely mistaken. After a quick google search, 
            I learned of the nth-child function from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child" target="_blank">this website</a>
            and I figured this was the way to alternate each block's color. I soon realized that 
            this method would require an inner alternation as well. So I tried this sample code:
        </p>
        <section>
            <pre>
                tr:nth-child(odd)> td:nth-child(odd) {
                    background-color:white;
                }
            </pre>
        </section>
        <p>
            I did this for the rest of the possibilities and it made the checkerboard pattern.
            Doing that, I was able to complete the table with just copying and pasting rather than
            trying to alternate the class elements manually. After this, I learned about the manipulation
            of box models.
