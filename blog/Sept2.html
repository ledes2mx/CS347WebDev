        <p>Today, I  relearned a solid amount of material that I 
            had previously learned, such as headings, lists, and
            links to other parts of the page that have an ID,
            but I also learned that it is possible to make
            words scroll on a screen like a marquee, which I 
            did not even know was possible. For example:<br>
        </p>
        <section>
            <marquee>These words are on a marquee!</marquee>
        </section>
        <p>I also learned that it is possible to change the background
            of a page in HTML to any color. In the example in the textbook
            the code changed the background of the page to blue with this code
            in the head section of the page...
        </p>
        <section>
            <pre>
                body {
                    background-color: cornflowerblue;
                }
            </pre>
        </section>
        <p>
            Furthermore, I learned a simple way to make the format of a text
            stay the way it is written in an HTML document with the &ldquo;pre&rdquo;
            function as well as how to make curly quotes so that text looks cleaner to
            those who are more used to tradional quotation marks. But above all else,
            I learned how to change the color of text in a paragraph from 
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_styles.asp" target="_blank">here</a> which requires that you change
            the color of a text in the tag. For example...
        </p>
        
        <section>
            <pre>
                Changing the color of a header is done like this
                    &lt;h1 style="color:red;"&gt;This is a red h1!!!&lt;/h1&gt;
            </pre>
        </section>
        <p>
            In practice it will look like this...
        </p>
        <h1 style="color:red;">This is a red h1!!!</h1>

        <p>
            Again, I picked this up from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_styles.asp" target="_blank">here</a> which contains more
            of this practice and examples.
