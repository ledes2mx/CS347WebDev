            I know we won't be talking about anything else other than react this semester,
            but I just wanted to look into jquery and what that had to offer just out of interest.
            It turns out there are a bunch of weird things that you can do with this.
            For example, there is a toggle effect that you can use if you ever need to toggle
            something for whatever reason. For example, take the little section below I have made,
            the button at the bottom gets the whole section to collapse on itself when pressed, and
            expands when pressed again.
        </p>

        <script>
            $(document).ready(function() {
                //$("p").text("The DOM is now loaded - you're ready to go!");
                $("#thirdp").text("The DOM is now loaded - you're ready to go!");
                $("button").click(function() {
                    $("section").slideToggle();
                });
            });
            </script>

        <section>
            <p>The DOM hasn't finished loading yet</p>
            <p>Not yet</p>
            <p id="thirdp"> Still not ready</p>
        </section>

        <button>Toggle between slide up and slide down for all paragraphs</button>

        <p>
            This is just one of the features of jquery that I have looked into at the moment, but I feel that
            there is much more that I haven't seen yet. I am not sure as to the use of this other than just
            having these functions available so that it makes doing stuff like this easier, but I will probably
            look into it more. It's also written in an incredibly weird way... that's probably something to look
            into as well.¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The code to do this is below.
        </p>
        <pre>
            $(document).ready(function() {
                //$("p").text("The DOM is now loaded - you're ready to go!");
                $("#thirdp").text("The DOM is now loaded - you're ready to go!");
                $("button").click(function() {
                    $("section").slideToggle();
                });
            });
        </pre>

    </body>
