            This week, I learned how to host and link together two URLs that 
            you intend to use together. If that sentence was not clear, I basically
            learned how to link a URL to a sub-URL. I know that this was a project
            early in the class, but I didn't actually link the URL to the blog.site
            correctly, instead of the link being to, in my case "blog.miguelcodessometimes.me"
            I was just directing the user to the directory from the main site, so the URL
            would never show the "blog." section. I was confused about it, but I read something
            <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/adding-a-subdomain-on-apache2">Here</a>,
            and I figured that the sub-domain was working, but I still had the same issue. Then I compared my
            main site "miguelcodessometimes.me" to my blog "blog.miguelcodessometimes.me" and it turns out that
            they are different because links that I had clicked on previously were still blue instead of purple,
            so I linked them together in the html like this:
        </p>
        
        <pre>
            &lt;a href="http://blog.miguelcodessometimes.me/."&gt;Click here to see the blog!&lt;/a&gt;
        </pre>

        <p>
            I don't know if I was just being dumb here or if there is another way to do this, but I feel like I am 
            on the right track here. I also learned how to add a Favicon, just out of interest. You will see that I
            changed it from the default image to a free use image I got from 
            <a href="https://www.clipartmax.com/middle/m2i8m2Z5m2b1A0b1_favicon-logo/">here</a>. I learned how to even
            change the favicon from <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-a-favicon-to-your-website-with-html">Digital Ocean</a>.
            I learned that it actually isn't that hard to change the favicon. In the source code for this page, I changed it like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
            &lt;link rel="shortcut icon" type="image" href="blogImages/favicon.png"&gt;
        </pre>
    </body>
