        <h1>14 of October, 2021</h1>
        <p>
            I know that this is just a little thing about javascript that I didn't know about, but I just found it interesting that the date at the top or bottom of some
            web pages that have that thing that says "Last modified : " and then the last modification date sits right next to it actually is javascript and not just a
            hard coded date in HTML. So I learned of this because I was looking through other websites a while ago, and I just figured that those were nothing special,
            but in another class, we talked about the date of last modification when checking how old a document or article was, and I, out of interest, wanted to know if
            there was an easy way to not change the date of last modification every time you update your page, so I googled the last modification date in html and once again,
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_doc_lastmodified.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> comes to the rescue with the syntax "document.lastModified."
            So I put it in a document like this...
        </p>
        <pre>
            &lt;p&gt;Last modified:
                &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
                    document.write(document.lastModified);
                &lt;/script&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
            This unfortunately doesn't look too good since it comes up with the date and time. To break it up,
            I did a little more research and came up with this instead...
        </p>
        <pre>
            &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
                var update = new Date(document.lastModified);
                var modMonth = update.getMonth() + 1;
                var modDate = update.getDate();
                var modYear = update.getFullYear();
                document.write("Last updated: " + modMonth + "/" + modDate + "/" + modYear);
            &lt;/script&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>I'll show both of these examples below!</p>

        <section>
            <p>Last Modified first example: 
                <script type="text/javascript">
                    document.write(document.lastModified);
                </script>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>
                <script type="text/javascript">
                    var update = new Date(document.lastModified);
                    var modMonth = update.getMonth() + 1;
                    var modDate = update.getDate();
                    var modYear = update.getFullYear();
                    document.write("Last Modified second example: " + modMonth + "/" + modDate + "/" + modYear);
                </script>
            </p>
        </section>
