        <h1>How I would teach this class.</h1>
        <p>
            I honestly wouldn't do much more differently than what you have done
            with us. I quite liked the whole labs every day, come in with questions
            and at least try to do the lab. Though I think that maybe the HTML CSS
            portion of the class might be able to be shorter, at least the first
            couple of chapters in the book could be crammed into one chapter, I feel
            that the speed of the class was good, though I would have liked to spend
            a little more time on React, but that might just be me because I have
            never seen anything like this. It also helped that I was interested in
            this sort of thing anyway, and the blogs pushing to learn more outside of
            what we do in the classroom was very much helpful as well. I really liked
            looking for things that I might not have seen otherwise. I think the thing
            that put me a little behind was not reading the book at the end, which was
            due to personal issues and work, but if I did have more time with it, I think
            I would have done even better and been able to do things a little faster.
